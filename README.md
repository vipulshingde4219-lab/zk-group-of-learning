1. Project Title
ZK Proof of Learning – Privacy-Preserving Course Completion on Stacks

2. Project Description
This smart contract provides a minimal and privacy-focused system to store and verify zero-knowledge proofs of course completion on the Stacks blockchain.
Instead of revealing exam content, answers, or detailed scores, a learner submits a hash commitment of their ZK proof. Verifiers can later check if the proof matches without accessing private learning data.

3. Project Vision
To enable trustless, verifiable, and privacy-preserving proof of learning for online education, certifications, and skill verification — allowing learners to prove course completion without disclosing sensitive exam materials.

4. Future Scope
Full ZK verification inside the contract (e.g., Groth16 or Halo2 verification in Clarity with off-chain proof generation).

Issuer-signed attestations to ensure authenticity.

Support for selective disclosure (e.g., proof of score above a threshold without revealing the exact score).

Integration with decentralized identity (DID) for non-transferable credentials.

Revocation system for expired or invalid proofs.

5. Contract Address
SP000000000000000000002Q6VF78.contract-zk-proof-of-learning
(Replace with deployed address once deployed on Stacks mainnet/testnet)
